In this notebook, we will be working with a dataset that contains information extracted from images of genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. The data were digitized using an industrial camera typically used for print inspection. The images have a resolution of about 660 dpi.

The dataset contains the following features:

Variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
Skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
Curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
Entropy of image (continuous)
Class (integer)
The 'Class' feature is our target variable. It indicates whether the banknote is genuine or forged.

We will apply various classification algorithms to this dataset and compare their performance. The goal is to determine which algorithm is most effective for this particular task.
